I created this site as a place to document what I’m learning as a Computer Science BS/MS student with an interest in cybersecurity.

Right now, I’m still very early in areas like reverse engineering. I wanted a space where I could write things down as I work through them — what I try, what doesn’t work, and what eventually clicks.

Most posts here will be informal and process-focused. Rather than polished tutorials, you’ll see notes from CTF challenges, labs, coursework, and small experiments. The goal is to capture *how* I think through problems and track progress over time.

This site is primarily for me, but if something here is useful to someone else, that’s a bonus.

More to come as I keep learning.
